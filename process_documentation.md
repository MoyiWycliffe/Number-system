## 1. Project Overview

This project automates the conversion of numbers from one numbering system to another â€” supporting Binary, Octal, Decimal, and Hexadecimal systems.  
It aims to simplify number conversion by providing an intuitive web-based interface and enabling deployment on both mobile and web platforms.

---

## 2. Objectives

- Design and implement a user-friendly number system converter.  
- Automate conversions between Binary, Octal, Decimal, and Hexadecimal systems.  
- Deploy the solution on both web and mobile (Android & iOS).  
- Collaborate as a team using GitHub version control.  
- Document both the process and the final program clearly.

## 3. Tools and Technologies

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| **HTML5** | Structure of the web app |
| **CSS3** | Styling and layout |
| **JavaScript (ES6)** | Core conversion logic |
| **Git & GitHub** | Version control and collaboration |
| **GitHub Pages** | Web deployment |
| **Capacitor / Cordova** | Mobile packaging for Android & iOS |

## 4. Development Process

### Step 1: Planning

- Defined project scope and requirements.
- Created a GitHub repository: `MoyiWycliffe/Number-system`
- Assigned roles among five group members.

### Step 2: Design

- Designed a clean, responsive interface using HTML & CSS.
- Applied modern UI features (glassmorphism, gradients).

### Step 3: Implementation

- Wrote `script.js` to handle base conversions dynamically.
- Implemented validation and user feedback handling.

### Step 4: Testing

- Tested conversions for accuracy (binary, octal, decimal, hex).  
- Tested interface on desktop and mobile browsers.

### Step 5: Deployment

- Deployed to **GitHub Pages** for live access.
- Wrapped app into **Android/iOS build** using Capacitor (optional).

---

## 5. Collaboration Process

- GitHub was used for version control and issue tracking.
- Each member worked on a specific part (UI, logic, documentation, etc.).
- Lecturer added as **collaborator** under repo â†’ Settings â†’ Collaborators.

---

## 6. Challenges Faced

- Handling invalid number inputs across bases.  
- Maintaining accuracy in large base conversions.  
- Packaging web code for Android and iOS.

---

## 7. Conclusion

This project demonstrates the ability to automate number conversions through an interactive and portable app.  
The process involved team collaboration, documentation, deployment, and code testing â€” fulfilling all CAT ONE SPC 2207 requirements.
